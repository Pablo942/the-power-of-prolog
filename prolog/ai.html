    <h1>Artificial Intelligence with Prolog</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    What is <i>intelligence</i>? Various explanations and definitions
    have been put forward by different researchers.
    <i>Intelligence</i> has been defined, among many other proposals,
    as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge, and as the capacity
    for logical reasoning and self-awareness. It has been related to
    understanding, solving, planning, and several other concepts and
    tasks. It has been categorized into different <i>kinds</i> of
    intelligence, such as <i>emotional</i> intelligence, <i>social</i>
    intelligence and so on.


    <br><br>

    The word stems from the Latin verb <i>intellego</i> "I understand,
    realize, perceive, see, notice" (among other meanings),
    from <i>lego</i> "I gather, collect, take, read" (among other meanings).

    <br><br>

    Since no generally accepted definition of <i>intelligence</i> is
    available, it is even harder to define what <i>artificial</i>
    intelligence is. Broadly speaking, we can distinguish
    two different <i>categories</i> of artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI):

    <ul>
      <li><b>strong</b> AI: This means a mechanism whose intellectual
        ability is indistinguishable from that of a human.
      </li>
      <li><b>weak</b> AI: This means a mechanism that automates a
        subset of human abilities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    So far, we have seen a lot of progress in <i>weak</i>&nbsp;AI. For
    example, machines have been built that
    play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">chess</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">Go</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)">Jeopardy</a>
    and many other games even better than the most able humans. Many
    of us are routinely using partially self-driving trains and
    subways, and we currently witness the first attempts at
    self-driving&nbsp;cars.

    <br><br> In contrast, <i>strong</i> AI has remained out of reach.
    In fact, it has
    been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus%27s_views_on_artificial_intelligence">argued</a>,
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">further&nbsp;argued</a>,
    that strong&nbsp;AI is <i>inherently</i> impossible to implement.

    <h2>Approaches</h2>

    Broadly speaking, we distinguish two possible <i>approaches</i>
    towards implementing&nbsp;AI:

    <ol>
      <li><b>symbolic</b> approaches:
        <ul>
          <li>rule-based <a href="expertsystems">expert&nbsp;systems</a></li>
          <li><a href="theoremproving">theorem&nbsp;provers</a></li>
          <li>intelligent forms of <a href="sorting#searching">search</a></li>
          <li>constraint-based approaches</li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>statistical</b> approaches:

        <ul>
          <li>neural&nbsp;nets</li>
          <li>machine learning&nbsp;(ML)</li>
          <li>data mining</li>
          <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    Both approaches have been widely known among researchers, and have
    also been used in practice, for many decades. Prolog is frequently
    associated with <i>symbolic</i> approaches. Well-known
    applications of this kind are planning tasks such
    as <a href="/wumpusworld/">Wumpus&nbsp;World</a>, <a href="/zurg/">Escape
    from Zurg</a>, <a href="/conn4/">Connect&nbsp;4</a>,
    scheduling tasks such as <a href="/simsttab/">timetabling</a>
    and <a href="/sgp/">sports tournaments</a>, and also other
    combinatorial tasks such as <a href="/queens/">N&nbsp;queens</a>
    and <a href="/sudoku/">Sudoku</a>. Prolog can of course also
    implement statistical approaches. For example, check
    out <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/index.html">ProbLog</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/friguzzi/cplint">cplint</a>
    and <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/aibook/code/ailog/ailog2.html">AILog&nbsp;2</a>
    for <i>probabilistic</i> logic programming and reasoning with
    uncertainties.

    <br><br>

    The approaches have different advantages and drawbacks: A symbolic
    approach is typically amenable to formal <i>verification</i>. The
    rules are explicitly available, and you can check whether they are
    complete, and whether they express what you intend.
    Using <i>inductive</i> logic programming (ILP), you can even let a
    program <i>learn</i> rules based on positive and negative
    examples. See for example
    the <a href="https://github.com/metagol/metagol">Metagol</a>
    system. However, not all tasks are amenable to symbolic
    approaches, because the rules may be <i>too hard to express</i>.
    For example, it is hard to express rules that determine whether a
    musical&nbsp;piece is borderline atonal, or whether a photo
    contains a painting of a flower.

    <br><br>

    On the other hand, statistical approaches have the ability to
    acquire rules <i>implicitly</i>, based on
    so-called <i>training-</i>, <i>test-</i>
    and <i>validation&nbsp;sets</i>. This is convenient, because you
    do not have to think about the rules yourself, and the machine may
    derive rules that are too hard for you to encode. Unfortunately,
    this also comes with significant drawbacks: You can no longer
    reason about the rules explicitly, and the obtained mechanism may
    produce colossal outliers that are hard to remedy. For example, it
    may misclassify the picture of a penguin as a car if you change a
    single&nbsp;pixel.

    <h2>Prolog and AI</h2>

    Prolog has very strong historic ties with AI. In 1982, Japan
    started a very ambitious government project called the <b>Fifth
    Generation Computer System</b>&nbsp;(FGCS) with the goal to create
    a massively&nbsp;parallel computer, using <i>concurrent
    logic&nbsp;programming</i> as the software foundation of the
    project.

    <br><br>

    When I visited Japan, I asked a retired Japanese scientist who had
    worked on the project why the project had failed. He said: "What
    do you mean, '<i>failed</i>'? All my colleagues who have worked on
    the project went on to become <i>professors</i>!" Another
    researcher told me that the project achieved what was actually
    intended: a way to input Japanese characters into computers.

    <br><br>

    In my view, a major achievement of the scientists who had worked
    on this project was that they managed to convince the government
    to fund an interesting and very&nbsp;ambitious project with
    large&nbsp;sums.

    <br><br>

    By the end of the FGCS project, commodity hardware had become so
    powerful that custom-built machines as those constructed by the
    project were hardly needed anymore.

    <br><br>

    Now, several decades later, is it not time
    to <i>try&nbsp;again</i>? Is it not time to convince <i>our</i>
    governments and funding agencies that we want to benefit from the
    power of Prolog to build applications, and do interesting
    research?

    <br><br>

    Here are a few ideas:

    <ul>
      <li>Write a <i>chatbot</i> that answers questions to the administration.</li>
      <li>Write an application that guides students through solving
        tasks, so that it can be used in computer-aided education. See <a href="/rits/">RITS</a> for an example.</li>
      <li>Find a way to <i>formalize legislation</i>, so that
        questions about laws can be automatically answered. For an
        example, check out a Prolog formulation of
        the <a href="https://github.com/bitlaw-jp/the-constitution-of-japan">constitution
        of Japan</a>,
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGG3e_1JX7Q">Reasoning
        with Regulations</a> as instances
        of <b>smart&nbsp;contracts</b>.
      </li>
    </ul>
